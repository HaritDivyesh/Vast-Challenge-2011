CS690V Project: VAST Challenge 2011
By: Divyesh Harit

The code requires VAST Challenge 2011 data files. Keep MC1’s microblogs file which contains the geo-coded timestamped messages in the same directory as the ipynb, name it “vc2011_microblogs.csv”, and MC3’s text articles in a folder in this same directory, name the folder “MC_3_Materials_4_4_2011”. The text files names should start from 00001.txt and end at 04474.txt (this is unchanged from the original dataset).

Basically, the directory structure would be:
-Main
  |————Report
  |————Poster
  |————Jupyter notebook
  |————vc2011_microblogs.csv
  |————MC_3_Materials_4_4_2011
		|————————00001.txt, 00002.txt………04474.txt
